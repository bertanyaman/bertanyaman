- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bertan. I am a front-end developer who is motivated to combine the art of design with the art of programming. I graduated from the University of Kocaeli in Computer Programming and from Anadolu University in the Faculty of Business Administration. I took English courses in London and I lived almost for a year to practise my English. I specialized in programming with Vanilla Javascript. Over the last 5 years, I have been involved in creating a SaaS project from scratch. This project is a cloud-based project and targets a total of 2 million active users in the future.
